# The-Original-Problem

Used fastai to train neural net to classify between brick, ball and a cylinder, get there bounding boxes and a segmentation mask for all. The neural net used a pretrained resnet14 model, used transfer learning to customize the neural net for classification.Trained the model for classification and bounding box detection.
